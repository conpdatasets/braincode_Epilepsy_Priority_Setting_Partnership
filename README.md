# Overview

A Priority Setting Partnership for epilepsy and seizures was conducted by the Ontario Brain Institute, its epilepsy research program, EpLink, and the James Lind Alliance.

The final top 10 list reflects the priority areas of focus for research as identified by the Canadian epilepsy community, including genetic markers for diagnosis and treatment, concerns about living with the long-term effects of epilepsy, and addressing knowledge gaps in etiology and treatment approaches.
